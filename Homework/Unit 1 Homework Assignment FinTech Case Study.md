## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?     
Offshore Storage allowing users to preserve the value of their coins, using Haven’s own ‘Mint and Burn’ concept without compromising on security, privacy, and decentralization unlike other stable coins.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?     
A core metric that crypto currencies use to measure success is market cap. As of 15/08/2021 measuring by market cap Haven is ranked 429 out of 11,257* cryptocurrencies that are monitored on CoinMarketCap. It is a noticeable achievement to be ranked in the top 500 coins, it is also worth mentioningthat haven was ranked in the top 200.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?        
Technically any other stable coin is a Haven Protocol competitor. The problem with existing solutions is that they tend to fall into a few main problematic categories:
Fiat-collateralised — e.g. Tether. The fundamental issue with this method is that it is centralized and requires a large amount of trust in the company that is holding the fiat. It is not a long term solution and is counter-intuitive to exactly what crypto is trying to solve.
Crypto-collateralised — Backing a stablecoin with Ethereum/another Crypto. It’s Decentralised but as the backing isn’t stable either, a big enough price drop could exceed the amount of collateral and force you to liquidate. Not immune to crashes
Non-collateralised — Functions like a central bank by controlling the money supply of coins in order to move the price towards $1. This is a step in the right direction but still falls short. If the current price is $1.50, more coins are created and sold into the market to lower the price. If the current price drops to $0.50, coins can’t simply be burned so the central entity has to buy up coins in the market until the price hits $1.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)     
A Haven Protocol card that can be used world wide as well as an option to send XUSD straight to your bank account, this will skip the need to go through an exchange and further add to the privacy features of XHV. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?     
A big success of XHV is due to its privacy process and the option to store your 'wealth' out of 'governments prying eyes'. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?   
It would utilize the potential of blockchain to reinvent money, specifically in a way that does not have to go through the central banking system. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?     
As stated above blockchain potential to reinvent money and business.
